            Zezima started playing RuneScape in late June/early July of 2001, after one of his friends from the game
            Triple Triad X messaged him that he knew of a game that he felt Zezima would never be any good at,
            RuneScape. His first 99 skill was Smithing, which he achieved in July 2002, followed by 99 Cooking on 10
            November 2002 and 99 Fishing on 30 November 2003. He first achieved the top rank in the hiscores in October
            2003, but temporarily lost it when RuneScape 2 was released as he didn't train Runecrafting until Choppermad
            (who was ranked second at the time) reached level 73 in the skill. He achieved his 20th level 99 in Slayer
            on 9 July 2005, becoming the first player to attain level 99 in the skill. He obtained level 1980 total on 9
            July 2005, and level 2079 total on 4 October 2005, becoming the first player to achieve those milestones as
            well. At the time of the achievements, these were the highest overall levels a player could obtain. He
            became ranked top 100 in all skills on 19 March 2006, but has since lost that position.[3]

            On 14 June 2007, Zezima became the first person to attain one billion experience overall.[4] After the
            release of Summoning in January 2008, he lagged behind other players in the hiscores. On his YouTube channel
            Zezima0213, he stated that he quit playing competitively as the game is "getting progressively easier over
            time", and that he lost a sense of accomplishment in what he worked hard to achieve.[5]

            On 31 August 2013, Zezima attained level 99 Divination, becoming the 18th player to do so. As of 27 January
            2016, he has won 12 Seasonal HiScores competitions. He won his first competition, Red Imp Kills, on 6
            October 2013.[6] On 21 July 2016, Zezima achieved 200 million experience in all 27 skills, and 5.4 billion
            experience overall.[7]

            In the now dead FunOrb, a multiple small games website created by Jagex, Zezima was Rank 1 in Orb Points (an
            overall scoring system on the site).
