            <strong>Zezima</strong>, known outside RuneScape as <strong>Peter Zezima</strong>, is a cyberworld celebrity
            who was the highest ranked
            person in RuneScape overall for large portions of 2004-2007. He started playing in 2001, after a friend
            showed
            him the game, and has been playing since. He was the first player to achieve level 99 in Slayer, a total
            level
            of 1980 and 2079, and one billion experience overall. A Jagex Moderator in 2008 cited him as " arguably the
            most famous player of the game" and Zezima was quoted in the back of the book Betrayal at Falador.
