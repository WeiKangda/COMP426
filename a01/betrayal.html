            Mod Mark, a Jagex Moderator, asked Zezima if he would like to be quoted in the RuneScape novel Betrayal at
            Falador, and he accepted.[8] The quote, "The best thing ever (that doesn't give xp)" had been featured in
            the back of the book and originally appeared on the product page of the Jagex Store, but has since been
            removed from the page.
