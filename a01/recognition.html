            According to Mod Mark in 2008, Zezima was arguably the most famous player of the game.[8] In 2007, he made
            it onto the list of biggest role models in a study done by Cartoon Network's New Generations.[2] Also, on 8
            April 2009, Zezima was given Player Moderator status.[9] During RuneFest 2013, Jagex awarded him the Golden
            Gnome for "Lifetime Achievement".[10] The Golden Gnome Awards is an annual competition that recognizes
            members of the RuneScape community.[11] Zezima also appeared for a short interview in the RuneScape
            documentary released in 2017.[12]
